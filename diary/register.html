									<h2>Passion for Diary Writing</h2>
									</header>
								<hr />
								<p> It is often said that if you maintain a diary, you are considered to be organised in your real life, just as you would write your sequences of the day in the diary.
								It is a very good habit to have an account of all the happenings in your life.
								Jotting down the instants that give you pain and sorrow, would help in lessening your grief without having to share with anyone. Anyways, the diary won't ever make fun of your sadness. 
								Also, noting down events in your life that bring you joy helps in reliving those moments over and over again. I remember how I re-read those pages to cherish those memories.
								When you write, you pour your heart out. It is not always possible to share your feelings with anyone (happens with me). Writing about your mistakes will help you to fortify your spirits and that will eventually help in self growth.

								Don't think about wastage of time. Keep writing. Make it a habit. Howsoever your day was, just write about it. This acts as a therapy after bad days. You won't regret this later, for sure. Who knows, you'll eventually turn out to be the greatest writers of all time! :D Well, you'll definitely have something to look back on in future. :)</p>
